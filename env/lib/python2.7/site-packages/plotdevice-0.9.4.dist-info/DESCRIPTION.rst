PlotDevice is a Macintosh application used for computational graphic design. It provides an
interactive Python environment where you can create two-dimensional graphics
and output them in a variety of vector, bitmap, and animation formats. It is
meant both as a sketch environment for exploring generative design and as a
general purpose graphics library for use in stand-alone Python programs.

PlotDevice is a fork of NodeBox 1.9.7rc1 with support for modern versions of
Python and Mac OS.

The new version features:

* Enhanced command line interface.
* New text editor with tab completion, syntax color themes, and emacs/vi bindings.
* Video export in H.264 or animated gif formats (with GCD-based i/o).
* Added support for external editors by reloading the source when changed.
* Build system now works with Xcode or ``py2app`` for the application and ``pip`` for the module.
* Virtualenv support (for both installation of the module and running scripts with dependencies).
* External scripts can use ``from plotdevice import *`` to create a drawing environment.
* Simplified bezier & affine transform api using the python ‘with’ statement
* New compositing operations for blend mode, global opacity, and dropshadows
* Simplified typography commands with stylesheet-based character styles
* Now uses the system's Python 2.7 interpreter.

Requires:

* Mac OS X 10.9+
